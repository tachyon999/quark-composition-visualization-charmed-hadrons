# quark-composition-visualization-charmed-hadrons
Developing a program using Python language to visualize the quark composition according to the constituent quark model of ground-state charmed hadrons. The goal is to create a series of pie charts, where each chart represents a different charm particle, with the area of circle to be proportional to the particle's lifetime.
